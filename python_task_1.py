# **Question 1: Car Matrix Generation**
Under the function named generate_car_matrix write a logic that takes the dataset-1.csv as a DataFrame. Return a new DataFrame that follows the following rules:

values from id_2 as columns
values from id_1 as index
dataframe should have values from car column
diagonal values should be 0.

## **Question 2: Car Type Count Calculation**
Create a Python function named get_type_count that takes the dataset-1.csv as a DataFrame. Add a new categorical column car_type based on values of the column car:

low for values less than or equal to 15,
medium for values greater than 15 and less than or equal to 25,
high for values greater than 25.
Calculate the count of occurrences for each car_type category and return the result as a dictionary. Sort the dictionary alphabetically based on keys.

## **Question 3: Bus Count Index Retrieval**

## **Question 4: Route Filtering**

## **Question 5: Matrix Value Modification**
Create a Python function named multiply_matrix that takes the resulting DataFrame from Question 1, as input and modifies each value according to the following logic:

If a value in the DataFrame is greater than 20, multiply those values by 0.75,
If a value is 20 or less, multiply those values by 1.25.

## **Question 6: Time Check**
You are given a dataset, dataset-2.csv, containing columns id, id_2, and timestamp (startDay, startTime, endDay, endTime). The goal is to verify the completeness of the time data by checking whether the timestamps for each unique (id, id_2) pair cover a full 24-hour period (from 12:00:00 AM to 11:59:59 PM) and span all 7 days of the week (from Monday to Sunday).
