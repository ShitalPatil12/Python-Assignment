## **Question 1: Distance Matrix Calculation**
Create a function named calculate_distance_matrix that takes the dataset-3.csv as input and generates a DataFrame representing distances between IDs.

The resulting DataFrame should have cumulative distances along known routes, with diagonal values set to 0. If distances between toll locations A to B and B to C are known, then the distance from A to C should be the sum of these distances. Ensure the matrix is symmetric, accounting for bidirectional distances between toll locations (i.e. A to B is equal to B to A).
